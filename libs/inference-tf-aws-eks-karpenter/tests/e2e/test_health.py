"""E2E tests for the `jd health` command on the EKS Karpenter template.

Modeled on the eks-oidc health e2e, adapted to this template's air-gapped shape:
  - the cluster / components / images layers apply;
  - the load-balancer and connection layers self-skip (endpoints-only VPC, no public
    ingress/ELB, no open_url) — these tests ASSERT that skip, so a future regression that
    accidentally wires an LB/connection check is caught.

Marked `full_deployment`: they read a live deployment (fast, no GPU) but require the
cluster to exist, so they run in the full-deploy path (or against an existing project
with `--with-full-deployment`).
