# aws_iam_service_linked_role would collide when two deployments in one account both
# enable FSx (second apply fails "role has been taken"), and on destroy could yank it
# out from under a peer deployment's file system (jd down hangs). FSx auto-creates
# the SLR on the first CreateFileSystem call, so on a truly fresh account the very
# first apply MAY hit an InvalidServiceLinkedRole race — documented, easy to retry.
# Every subsequent apply (in this account or any other) is a no-op. This matches the
# same "shared account-regional singleton, not TF-managed" pattern pullthrough.tf uses
# for the ECR pull-through cache rule.

# --- Data Repository Association: Lustre root ⇄ s3://<model_store>/models/ ---
#
# `file_system_path = "/"` maps the S3 `models/` prefix directly to the Lustre
# root. The FSx CSI PV mounts Lustre root (no subdir) at the pod's mountpoint,
# and pods mount at /models (see local.fsx_mount_path + charts/storage/fsx-mount.yaml),
# so an S3 object at `models/model-a/config.json` shows up at pod path
# `/models/model-a/config.json` — same layout as the S3-mount (Mountpoint) PV,
# so a track can flip backends without changing its mount paths.
#
# Earlier attempts set `file_system_path = "/models"` here. That put S3 content
# at Lustre `/models/*`, which the PV (rooted at Lustre `/`) then exposed at pod
# `/models/models/*` — one level deeper than every consumer expected. The
# hydration Job's `/mnt/models/$PREFIX` path then referenced Lustre `/$PREFIX`
# (a nonexistent path), took the "doesn't exist" fallback branch, touched the
# sentinel, and reported success while warming zero bytes. Roborev flagged this
# on every commit before the fix.
#
# S3 is the source of truth. Import events reflect onboarder writes into Lustre;
# export events off — workloads never write back.
# batch_import_meta_data_on_create indexes every pre-existing object at DRA-create
# time (otherwise only files uploaded AFTER DRA creation appear in Lustre).
#
# DELETED intentionally NOT in auto_import events: an S3-side delete (lifecycle
# rule fire, compromised principal, mis-configured bucket policy) would otherwise
# propagate to Lustre within seconds and evict the running workload's weights
# with no undo path. Explicit resync via `terraform destroy` on the DRA + reapply
# stays the only path — an auditable operator action, not a runbook near-miss.
#
# imported_file_chunk_size is the S3-object → Lustre-OST stripe granularity at
# metadata-import time. AWS recommends 16 MiB for large tensor files so a single
# weight file fans across OSTs (parallel reads); 1024 MiB (the old default) makes
