# === FSx observability — alarms + Grafana view ===
#
# Two independent signals, both gated on enable_fsx:
#
#  1. CloudWatch alarms (native, no cluster surface) — fire regardless of whether
#     Grafana/Prometheus are healthy. Cover: event-log WARN/ERROR/FAILED bursts
#     (DRA import failures, service warnings) and FreeStorageCapacity < 20%
#     (capacity headroom before writes 500-error). SNS-agnostic — alarms exist
#     in-Console; users wire their preferred pager by adding alarm_actions later.
#
#  2. Grafana CloudWatch data source — kube-prometheus-stack's Grafana Deployment
#     gets a Pod Identity role scoped to cloudwatch:GetMetricData/ListMetrics on
#     the AWS/FSx namespace, plus a datasource yaml that points at the region's
#     CloudWatch. FSx metrics (DataReadBytes, DataWriteBytes, MetadataOperations,
#     FreeStorageCapacity, LogicalDiskUsage) show up alongside cluster metrics in
#     the same Grafana instance. No new pod, no yace vendoring, reuses the
#     already-provisioned `monitoring` VPC endpoint.

# --- Alarm 1: log-metric filter on the FSx event log ---
#
# CloudWatch alarms can't fire directly on a log stream — the pattern is: filter
# → metric → alarm. Emits FsxEventCount incremented by 1 for each line matching
# WARN|ERROR|FAILED. Alarm on sum > 0 over 5 min (any hit in the window pages).
#
# Per-deployment isolation is baked into the METRIC NAME (not dimensions).
# CloudWatch Logs' PutMetricFilter rejects `dimensions` on a keyword-match
# pattern ("The specified filter pattern does not support dimensions") because
# dimensions require the filter to extract named fields from log events.
# Embedding deployment_id in the metric name gives the same per-deployment
# alarm isolation without the extraction complexity.

# capacity × per_unit_throughput at TF-apply time) to get a saturation ratio.
#
# Why 15 min sustained: transient spikes (KEDA cold-start of a big fleet,
# hydration replay after a maintenance event) are expected and fine. Sustained
# saturation is the "bump the throughput tier" signal — see FSX_TUNING.md for

# --- Grafana CloudWatch data source (T2.2) ---
#
# Adds a `cloudwatch:GetMetricData` + `ListMetrics` scoped IAM role for Grafana's
# SA (the kube-prometheus-stack Grafana Deployment). Then configures the chart's
# `additionalDataSources` so Grafana registers a CloudWatch data source pointing
# at the deployment's region. Reuses the already-provisioned `monitoring` VPC
# interface endpoint — no NAT, no public egress needed.
#
# Action-scoped policy: CloudWatch read APIs Grafana needs (GetMetricData +
# discovery). `cloudwatch:namespace` is NOT a valid condition key for these
# read actions per the CloudWatch Service Authorization Reference — only
# PutMetricData supports it. A previous attempt scoped GetMetricData to
# `cloudwatch:namespace = "AWS/FSx"`; the condition would never match, IAM
# would deny every request, and the Grafana panels would silently render
# empty (invisible to CI, only caught by looking at Grafana at runtime).
# Scope is achieved via the datasource's `customMetricsNamespaces` config
# (see kubernetes_config_map_v1.grafana_fsx_datasource below), which the
# Grafana query client uses to restrict its `Namespace` param on each call.
