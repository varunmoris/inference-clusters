"""onboarder: rehost a consumer artifact's images/weights into our ECR/S3.

This cluster runs on an endpoints-only VPC — nodes reach only this account's regional
ECR and S3, no public egress. So a workload's images and weights must be rehosted
before they can run here. This job does that rehost and emits ONE air-gapped artifact
the deployer applies.

TWO input formats are supported and auto-detected from the unpacked artifact dir:

  Path A — Helm chart (Chart.yaml present):
      values.yaml carries an `images:` block (mandated) + optional `weights:` block,
      each a structured object. We digest-vendor every image to <ecr>/workload/<repo>
      and (optionally) ingest weights to s3://<bucket>/models/<name>, then emit
      `overrides.yaml` (same shape, pointing at our ECR/S3). Backstop: `helm template`
      with the overrides, asserting every rendered image resolves to our ECR.

  Path B — KRO graph, no Helm (graph.yaml present):
      graph.yaml is a valid KRO ResourceGraphDefinition with LITERAL upstream refs
      baked in (so it also works on a non-air-gapped cluster). A sidecar values.yaml
      lists the field-paths to rehost:
          images:  [ "resources[0].template.spec...containers[0].image", ... ]
          weights: [ "resources[0].template.spec...containers[0].args[0]", ... ]
          builds:  [ {path, context, name, tag}, ... ]   # images with NO upstream to import
      We read the literal ref at each `images:` path, vendor it (skopeo copy), and — for each
      `builds:` entry — BUILD the source dir at `context` into our ECR via the image-build
      primitive (there is no upstream to skopeo-copy). Both then write a REWRITTEN COPY —
      `graph-air-gapped.yaml` — with our ECR/S3 refs. graph.yaml is left pristine.
      Backstop: field-level — every listed image-path in the emitted graph resolves to
      our ECR `@sha256:`, every weight-path to our S3 (cluster-independent).

This module is the single source of truth for the onboard logic. It is base64-embedded
into the CodeBuild buildspec (engine/onboarder.tf) and also imported directly by the
unit tests (tests/unit/test_onboarder.py) — the pure core (parse/rewrite/emit)
is exercised without CodeBuild, with the side-effecting Runner faked. Deps are stdlib +
pyyaml + boto3 + huggingface_hub (boto3 for the server-side S3 weight copy, with a
byte-streaming fallback; huggingface_hub for hf:// snapshot downloads) — the CodeBuild
job gets them from its image plus the buildspec pip install, and the tests get them
from the package dependencies; the module stays a single embeddable file.

Env (all required unless noted):
  CHART_DIR         local path to the unpacked artifact (chart or graph dir)
  ECR_REGISTRY      <acct>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com
  WORKLOAD_PREFIX   ECR repo prefix for vendored workload images (cluster-scoped, e.g.
                    "<cluster>/workload"; default "workload")
  MODELS_S3_URI     s3://<bucket>/models  (weights land under here as <name>/)
  OUT_DIR           where the emitted artifact + result manifest are written
                    (default: $CHART_DIR/..)
  IMAGE_BUILD_PROJECT       CodeBuild project that BUILDS a source dir into a workload/* ECR
                    image (the image-build primitive). Required ONLY when a graph values.yaml
                    declares a `builds:` block (an image with no published upstream to import);
                    unused otherwise.
  IMAGE_BUILD_INPUT_S3_URI  s3://<bucket>/image-build/in — where the build-context tarball is
                    uploaded before the build is triggered. Required with a `builds:` block.
  RESOURCE_TAGS_JSON  JSON map of tags applied to any workload/* ECR repo the job creates
                    (attribution + DeploymentId reaping); optional, default no tags
  SKOPEO_EXTRA      extra skopeo args (tests set --dest-tls-verify=false etc.); optional
  DRY_RUN_COPY      "true" => skip the actual skopeo/s5cmd/ecr writes, still resolve
                    digests via `skopeo inspect` and emit the artifact; optional
