# --- Image supply: ECR pull-through for platform images ---
#
# On the endpoints-only VPC a node has no public egress. Platform images
# reach nodes via ECR pull-through: the node pulls from PRIVATE ECR over the
# ecr.dkr/ecr.api + S3 endpoints; ECR fetches the upstream server-side (AWS IPs)
# on a cache miss and stores it by digest in our account. Every later pull is a
# cache hit — fully private.
#
# No-credentials-only: ECR offers anonymous pull-through rules for exactly
# three upstreams — ECR Public, the Kubernetes registry, and Quay.
# Docker Hub/GHCR/etc. require an ecr-pullthroughcache/ Secrets Manager secret,
# which we deliberately refuse to own.

# Each cached repo is namespaced under the rule's prefix, e.g.
# public.ecr.aws/karpenter/... -> <acct>.dkr.ecr.<region>…/ecr-public/karpenter/...

# --- Vendored images (the OTHER supply path) ---
#
# Pull-through (above) covers images on the three no-creds upstreams. Images that
# live ONLY on registries pull-through can't proxy (nvcr.io) or that require
# credentials our no-creds pull-through refuses (docker.io/ghcr.io) are instead
# mirrored into our own ECR via a server-side CodeBuild job. The copy runs in
# CodeBuild (public egress) — NOT on the jd host and NOT on a cluster node — so nodes
# stay air-gapped and pull the vendored copy from private ECR like any other image.
# This is the workload-vendoring engine pulled forward for the handful of
# platform images with no no-creds home. Add an entry → it gets an ECR repo, IAM
# scope, and a build trigger automatically.

# The EFA device-plugin image lives ONLY on the EKS-managed regional ECR (it is
# NOT on public.ecr.aws, so pull-through can't proxy it). That registry's account
# is region-specific (one account covers most regions, a distinct account for ~15
# opt-in/newer ones). Rather than hardcode a region→account map, we INFER the
# registry from an add-on EKS already installed: the vpc-cni (aws-node) DaemonSet's
# image is <account>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/amazon-k8s-cni:<tag> — whatever
# EKS resolved for THIS region/partition. The EFA image sits on the same registry,
# so we vendor it from there into our own ECR (like every other platform image),
# and nodes pull the private copy. Only read/vendored when EFA is enabled.
